#Light Illusion Calibration Images#

The supplied calibration images should be used to pre-set any display as accurately as possible using the monitor's manual controls.


The 'BrightnessCal' image should be used to set the black level (Brightness control) of the display.

The 'ContrastCal' image should be used to set the white level (Contrast control) of the display.

The 'ContrastRatio' image should be used to measure the true Contrast Ratio of the display. As the black and white patches are displayed simultaneously the resulting CR is an accurate representation of the display's true CR.

The 'SharpnessCal' image should be used to set the 'Sharpness' control of the display to show no 'edge' artefacts around the single pixel lines.

The 'Grey' image can be used to check the relative colour temperature balance of the display. Use a probe with LightSpace CMS Calibration option to measure if required.

The 'BarsAndBlack' image can be used to check for data/legal tv levels 0-255/0-1023 vs. 16-235/64-940.

The 'ColourRamp' and 'BWRamp' images are helpful to test any resulting calibration for general image artefacts and banding.


It is very important that accurate display setup is achieved before full profiling is performed.
